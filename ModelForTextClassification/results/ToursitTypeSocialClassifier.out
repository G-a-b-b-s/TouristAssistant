Searching with Lmod:
--------------------
  All searching (spider, list, avail, keyword) support regular expressions:
  

  -r spider           '^p'          Finds all the modules that start with
                                    `p' or `P'

                                    their name.
  -r spider           'mpi$         Finds all modules that end with "mpi" in
                                    their name.

Handling a collection of modules:
--------------------------------
  save | s                          Save the current list of modules to a
                                    user defined "default" collection.
